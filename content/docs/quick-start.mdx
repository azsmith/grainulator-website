Grainulator is a macOS granular/wavetable synthesizer with a built-in step sequencer, physical-modeling engines, effects, and hardware controller support. This guide will get you making sounds in under five minutes.

## Installation

1. Download Grainulator without Terminal:
   - From this site: [Download the latest `.dmg`](/Grainulator-0.7.1.dmg)
   - From GitHub Releases: `https://github.com/azsmith/grainulator/releases` -> open latest release -> **Assets** -> click `.dmg`
2. Optional GitHub source ZIP (no `git`):
   - Open `https://github.com/azsmith/grainulator`
   - Click **Code** -> **Download ZIP**
3. Optional: build from source (Terminal required):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azsmith/grainulator.git
   cd grainulator
   swift build -c release
   ```
4. Move **Grainulator.app** to your Applications folder and launch it.
5. On first launch, grant microphone access if prompted (required for live audio recording into granular buffers).

## Download Drum And Sample Libraries

### Robot Drummer kit (SFZ drum library)

1. Download Virtuosity Drums without Terminal:
   1. Open `https://github.com/sfzinstruments/virtuosity_drums`
   2. Click **Code** -> **Download ZIP**
   3. Unzip the archive in Finder
2. In Grainulator, go to **DRUMS -> Robot** and click **Locate Kits**.
3. Select either the unzipped root folder or its `Programs` folder.

### Add SF2/SFZ folders to Grainulator

1. Open **Settings -> Library**.
2. Click **Add Folder** and select the parent folder containing `.sf2` / `.sfz` files.
3. In **SAMPLER**, switch mode to **SF2** or **SFZ** and choose a file from the source menu.

## First Launch

When Grainulator opens you will see:

- **Transport bar** (upper row): Play/Stop, Record, BPM display, tap tempo, eight clock output pads.
- **Tab bar** (lower row): **SEQ** | **SYNTHS** | **GRAINS** | **DRUMS** — plus context-specific controls (swing settings appear when SEQ is active).
- **Floating windows**: Mixer and Oscilloscope can be opened from the transport bar.

The default view is the **SEQ** (sequencer) tab.

## Play Your First Sound

1. Click the **SYNTHS** tab in the tab bar.
2. The **Macro Osc** synth panel appears. It defaults to *Virtual Analog* mode.
3. Click the **TRIGGER** button (or press a key on a connected MIDI keyboard) to hear a note.
4. Experiment with the three main knobs:
   - **HARMONICS** — changes the waveform shape or timbre character
   - **TIMBRE** — adjusts brightness or spectral content
   - **MORPH** — blends between timbral variations
5. Open the model selector dropdown and try different engines: **Wavetable**, **Chords**, **Speech**, **String**, **Six-Op FM**, and more (**24 models total**).

> **Tip:** Models 11-15 (String through Hi-Hat) are *triggered* engines with built-in envelopes — they respond to note-on events and decay naturally.

## Load a Sample into Granular

1. Click the **GRAINS** tab. You'll see sub-navigation tabs for Voice 1-4, Slicer, and Looper.
2. On **Voice 1**, click the **LOAD** button and browse for an audio file (WAV, AIFF, MP3, etc.).
3. The waveform appears in the display. Click **PLAY** to start granular playback.
4. Adjust the grain parameters:
   - **SPEED** — playback rate (negative = reverse)
   - **PITCH** — pitch shift in semitones
   - **SIZE** — grain duration
   - **DENSITY** — how many grains overlap
   - **JITTER** — randomize grain start position
   - **SPREAD** — stereo width of grain cloud
   - **MORPH** — additional timbral morphing
5. Try different **envelope shapes** (Hanning, Gaussian, Pluck, Trapezoid, etc.) and **filter models** (10 options including Hyperion, DaisyLadder, and CytomicSVF) using the dropdowns below the waveform.

If you want to process another engine instead of an audio file, use the **Input Source** menu:

## Program a Sequence

1. Click the **SEQ** tab.
2. You see **two tracks** of **8 steps** each. Click a step pad to set its pitch within the current scale.
3. Set the **root note** and **scale** using the dropdowns in the header row (42 scales available).
4. Press **Play** on the transport bar. The sequencer triggers notes on your selected output (Macro Osc, Resonator, Both, Drums, or Sampler).
5. Change the **direction** mode (Forward, Reverse, Alternate, Random, Drunk Walk, and more) and **clock division** to reshape the rhythm.
6. Click any step to open its detail popover: adjust **probability**, **ratchets**, **gate mode**, **step type**, **slide**, and the **accumulator** system for evolving pitch patterns.
7. Use the **CHD** button per track when you want that track to follow chord intervals instead of the current fixed scale.

> **Tip:** Enable the **Chord Sequencer** section below the tracks to drive harmonic movement. You can set chord length from 1-8 steps, choose from preset categories, and program your own progression from 12 degrees and 17 chord qualities.

## First Beat (Robot Drummer)

1. Go to **DRUMS** and select **Robot** mode.
2. Choose a **Genre** and **Song Part**, then click **Generate**.
3. Raise **Kick**, **Snare**, and **Hi-Hat** complexity first.

If you want manual programming instead, switch to **Synth** mode:

## Record Your Output

1. Press the **Record** button (circle icon) on the transport bar.
2. Audio is captured as a **48 kHz / 24-bit stereo WAV** file.
3. Press **Stop** to finish recording. Files are saved to `~/Music/Grainulator/Recordings/`.

## Save a Project

1. Choose **File → Save** or **Save As**.
2. Projects are saved as `.grn` files.
3. Grainulator also writes an `audio/` folder next to the `.grn` file for reel audio data.

## Explore Further

Now that you have the basics, dig into these features:

- **Scramble** — Marbles-inspired probabilistic sequencer with 7 gate modes, 3 note outputs with Spread/Bias/Quantize shaping, Deja Vu looping, and flexible routing to any engine (SEQ tab)
- **Resonator** — physical-modeling resonator with 6 models, polyphony, and 11 chord types (SYNTHS tab)
- **DaisyDrums** — 5-lane × 16-step drum sequencer with synth/sample modes, **AI Drummer**, **12 drum kits**, **8-pattern bank**, and **pattern sequencer** for chaining patterns (DRUMS tab)
- **Swing & Humanize** — multi-level swing (global, per-track, per-drum-lane) with MPC and SINE algorithms, plus humanize for random timing/velocity variation
- **Slicer / Looper** — 2 voices with dual modes: **Slicer** (auto-slice into 8 segments, performance pattern grid, **Tape/VHS performance FX** with latch) and **Looper** (MLRE-inspired tape-loop with rate, reverse, and cut buttons). Buffer export to WAV. (GRAINS tab)
- **Mixer** — 8 channel strips with level/pan, dual sends, micro-delay, phase invert, FX return strips, and master section with non-linear fader law and -6dB summing headroom (floating window)
- **Effects** — tape-style delay, reverb, master filter, and a master bus compressor/limiter (compressor on by default at -3dB threshold)
- **Plugin Hosting** — switch AU or VST3 backend in **Settings → Audio → Plugin Hosting** (VST3 is marked experimental)
- **Clock Modulation** — 8 configurable clock outputs (CLK or LFO mode) with 25 modulation destinations across all engines
- **Sampler** — load SF2, SFZ, or WAV instruments with ADSR envelope and filter
- **Monome Arc / Grid** — hardware controller integration for hands-on performance
- **MIDI** — auto-discovered MIDI keyboards and controllers
- **AI Control** — natural-language control via the HTTP API on `localhost:4850`
