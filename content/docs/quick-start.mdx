Grainulator is a macOS granular/wavetable synthesizer with a built-in step sequencer, physical-modeling engines, effects, and hardware controller support. This guide will get you making sounds in under five minutes.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `.app` from the releases page, or build from source:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Grainulator
   swift build
   ```
2. Move **Grainulator.app** to your Applications folder and launch it.
3. On first launch, grant microphone access if prompted (required for live audio recording into granular buffers).

## First Launch

When Grainulator opens you will see:

- **Transport bar** across the top: Play/Stop, Record, BPM display, tap tempo, eight clock output pads, and workspace tab buttons.
- **Workspace tabs** (right side of transport bar): **SEQ** | **SYNTH** | **GRAN** | **DRUM**
- **Floating windows**: Mixer and Oscilloscope can be opened from the transport bar.

The default view is the **SEQ** (sequencer) tab.

## Play Your First Sound

1. Click the **SYNTH** tab in the transport bar.
2. The **Macro Osc** synth panel appears. It defaults to *Virtual Analog* mode.
3. Click the **TRIGGER** button (or press a key on a connected MIDI keyboard) to hear a note.
4. Experiment with the three main knobs:
   - **HARMONICS** — changes the waveform shape or timbre character
   - **TIMBRE** — adjusts brightness or spectral content
   - **MORPH** — blends between timbral variations
5. Open the model selector dropdown and try different engines: **Wavetable**, **Chords**, **Speech**, **String**, **Six-Op FM**, and more (**24 models total**).

> **Tip:** Models 11-15 (String through Hi-Hat) are *triggered* engines with built-in envelopes — they respond to note-on events and decay naturally.

## Load a Sample into Granular

1. Click the **GRAN** tab.
2. On **Voice 1**, click the **LOAD** button and browse for an audio file (WAV, AIFF, MP3, etc.).
3. The waveform appears in the display. Click **PLAY** to start granular playback.
4. Adjust the grain parameters:
   - **SPEED** — playback rate (negative = reverse)
   - **PITCH** — pitch shift in semitones
   - **SIZE** — grain duration
   - **DENSITY** — how many grains overlap
   - **JITTER** — randomize grain start position
   - **SPREAD** — stereo width of grain cloud
   - **MORPH** — additional timbral morphing
5. Try different **envelope shapes** (Hanning, Gaussian, Pluck, Trapezoid, etc.) and **filter models** (10 options) using the dropdowns below the waveform.

## Program a Sequence

1. Click the **SEQ** tab.
2. You see **two tracks** of **8 steps** each. Click a step pad to set its pitch within the current scale.
3. Set the **root note** and **scale** using the dropdowns in the header row (42 scales available).
4. Press **Play** on the transport bar. The sequencer triggers notes on your selected output.
5. Change the **direction** mode (Forward, Reverse, Alternate, Random, Drunk Walk, and more) and **clock division** to reshape the rhythm.
6. Click any step to open its detail popover: adjust **probability**, **ratchets**, **gate mode**, **step type**, **slide**, and the **accumulator** system.

> **Tip:** Enable the **Chord Sequencer** section below the tracks to drive harmonic movement.

## Record Your Output

1. Press the **Record** button (circle icon) on the transport bar.
2. Audio is captured as a **48 kHz / 24-bit stereo WAV** file.
3. Press **Stop** to finish recording. Files are saved to `~/Music/Grainulator/Recordings/`.

## Save a Project

1. Choose **File → Save** or **Save As**.
2. Projects are saved as `.grn` files.
3. Grainulator also writes an `audio/` folder next to the `.grn` file for reel audio data.

## Explore Further

Now that you have the basics, dig into these features:

- **Scramble** — Marbles-inspired probabilistic sequencer
- **Resonator** — physical-modeling resonator with 6 models
- **DaisyDrums** — 5 percussive engines with a 16-step drum sequencer
- **Looper** — 2 MLRE-inspired looper voices
- **Mixer** — 8 channel strips with sends and inserts
- **Effects** — tape delay, reverb, master filter, compressor
- **Hardware** — Monome Arc/Grid, MIDI auto-discovery
- **AI Control** — natural-language control via HTTP API
