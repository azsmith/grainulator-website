## Granular Synthesis

Grainulator provides **4 independent granular voices**, each with its own audio buffer, grain engine, and parameter set.

### Loading Audio

Click **LOAD** on any voice to open a file browser. Supported formats: WAV, AIFF, MP3, and other AVFoundation-supported formats.

> **Tip:** Try field recordings, vocal samples, orchestral hits, or full songs. Short percussive samples work well for rhythmic patterns; sustained tones are ideal for ambient pads.

### Grain Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| **Speed** | Playback rate. 1.0 = normal, 0.5 = half speed, negative = reverse |
| **Pitch** | Pitch shift in semitones (independent of speed) |
| **Size** | Grain duration in milliseconds |
| **Density** | Number of overlapping grains per second |
| **Jitter** | Randomization of grain start position |
| **Spread** | Stereo width of the grain cloud |
| **Morph** | Additional timbral morphing |

### Filter

Each voice has an independent filter with cutoff and resonance. Ten models available:

| # | Model | Character |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Stilson** | Bright, aggressive resonance |
| 1 | **Microtracker** | Vintage tracker / chiptune feel |
| 2 | **Krajeski** | Balanced, musical self-oscillation |
| 3 | **MusicDSP** | General-purpose, efficient |
| 4 | **Oberheim** | Smooth, rounded ladder |
| 5 | **Improved** | Enhanced ladder, cleaner resonance |
| 6 | **RK Simulation** | Runge-Kutta circuit simulation, very smooth |
| 7 | **Hyperion** | Extended range, rich harmonics (default) |
| 8 | **DaisyLadder** | Punchy analog character |
| 9 | **CytomicSVF** | Stable and versatile state-variable |

### Grain Envelope Shapes

| Shape | Description |
|---|---|
| **Hanning** | Smooth bell curve (default) |
| **Gaussian** | Very smooth, narrow peak |
| **Trapezoid** | Flat top with linear ramps |
| **Triangle** | Simple linear fade in/out |
| **Tukey** | Flat center with cosine edges |
| **Pluck** | Fast exponential decay |
| **Pluck Soft** | Slower exponential decay |
| **Exp Decay** | Pure exponential decay (percussive) |

### Recording into Buffers

| Setting | Options |
|---|---|
| **Mode** | One-Shot (record once) or Live Loop (continuous overdub) |
| **Source** | External (mic/input) or internal engine channels |
| **Feedback** | Overdub level (0 = destructive, 1 = full layer) |

## Looper

Two independent **MLRE-inspired looper voices** for tape-loop style recording and playback, inspired by monome mlr/mlrv.

### Controls

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Rate** | Playback speed (0.25x to 4x) |
| **Reverse** | Toggle reverse playback |
| **Loop Start** | Start position (0-1) |
| **Loop End** | End position (0-1) |
| **Cut (1-8)** | Eight cut buttons for position jumping |

> **Tip:** Load a drum loop and rapidly tap different cut positions for stutter and rearrangement effects. Combine with rate changes and reverse for glitch-style performance.
