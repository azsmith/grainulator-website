## Granular Synthesis

Grainulator provides **4 independent granular voices**, each with its own audio buffer, grain engine, and parameter set.

### Loading Audio

Click **LOAD** on any voice to open a file browser. Supported formats: WAV, AIFF, MP3, and other AVFoundation-supported formats.

> **Tip:** Try field recordings, vocal samples, orchestral hits, or full songs. Short percussive samples work well for rhythmic patterns; sustained tones are ideal for ambient pads.

Use the **Input Source** menu to route internal engines (for example Macro Osc, Resonator, Drums, or Sampler) into the granular voice:

### Grain Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| **Speed** | Playback rate. 1.0 = normal, 0.5 = half speed, negative = reverse |
| **Pitch** | Pitch shift in semitones (independent of speed) |
| **Size** | Grain duration in milliseconds |
| **Density** | Number of overlapping grains per second |
| **Jitter** | Randomization of grain start position |
| **Spread** | Stereo width of the grain cloud (-1 to +1 pan range) |
| **Morph** | Additional timbral morphing / grain parameter variation |

### Filter

Each voice has an independent filter with cutoff and resonance. Ten models available:

| # | Model | Character |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Stilson** | Bright, aggressive resonance |
| 1 | **Microtracker** | Vintage tracker / chiptune feel |
| 2 | **Krajeski** | Balanced, musical self-oscillation |
| 3 | **MusicDSP** | General-purpose, efficient |
| 4 | **Oberheim** | Smooth, rounded ladder response |
| 5 | **Improved** | Enhanced ladder model with cleaner resonance behavior |
| 6 | **RK Simulation** | Runge-Kutta circuit simulation, very smooth |
| 7 | **Hyperion** | Extended range, rich harmonics (default) |
| 8 | **DaisyLadder** | DaisySP ladder variant with punchy analog character |
| 9 | **CytomicSVF** | Cytomic state-variable filter model, stable and versatile |

### Grain Envelope Shapes

| Shape | Description |
|---|---|
| **Hanning** | Smooth bell curve (default) |
| **Gaussian** | Very smooth, narrow peak |
| **Trapezoid** | Flat top with linear ramps |
| **Triangle** | Simple linear fade in/out |
| **Tukey** | Flat center with cosine edges |
| **Pluck** | Fast exponential decay (plucked string character) |
| **Pluck Soft** | Slower exponential decay (nylon string character) |
| **Exp Decay** | Pure exponential decay from start (percussive) |

### Recording into Buffers

Each granular voice can record audio directly into its buffer:

| Setting | Options |
|---|---|
| **Mode** | One-Shot (record once, stop) or Live Loop (continuous overdub) |
| **Source** | External (microphone/audio input), or internal engine channels |
| **Feedback** | Live loop overdub level (0 = destructive replace, 1 = full layer) |

## Slicer / Looper

Two independent voices provide both **slicer** (performance slice triggering) and **looper** (tape-loop style playback) modes, inspired by the monome mlr/mlrv Max/MSP applications. Each voice maintains its own audio buffer that can be loaded from files or recorded live. The GRAINS tab shows a **SLICER** sub-tab and a **LOOPER** sub-tab for each voice.

### Modes

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **Slicer** | Divides the buffer into up to 8 slices. Slices are triggered individually by the performance pattern grid or manually. Continuous loop playback is disabled — only triggered slices produce sound. |
| **Looper** | Traditional tape-loop playback with rate control, reverse, and cut buttons for live performance. |

### Slicer Mode

#### Auto-Slicing

When audio is loaded or recorded, the slicer automatically divides the buffer into **8 equal slices**. Slice boundaries can be manually adjusted after auto-slicing.

#### Per-Slice Parameters

Each of the 8 slices has independent controls:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| **Start** | Slice start position within the buffer (normalized 0-1) |
| **End** | Slice end position within the buffer (normalized 0-1) |
| **Speed** | Playback speed for this slice |
| **Level** | Output level for this slice |
| **Reverse** | Play this slice in reverse |
| **One-Shot** | Play slice once (no loop) vs. loop continuously while held |

#### Performance Pattern Grid (8 slices × 16 steps)

The slicer includes a **step sequencer grid** for triggering slices rhythmically:

- **8 rows** (one per slice) × **16 columns** (steps)
- Click cells to toggle slice triggers on/off
- The pattern is synced to the master transport via the master clock's sample-accurate beat position
- A configurable **clock division** controls the step rate (same 20 divisions as the step sequencer)
- The **playhead** shows the current step position during playback

When the transport plays, the pattern scheduler triggers the corresponding slices at each step. Multiple slices can trigger simultaneously on the same step.

#### Waveform Display

The waveform overview uses **2048-point resolution** for precise transient visibility and accurate slice boundary placement. Slice boundaries are shown as overlay markers on the waveform.

### Performance FX

Each slicer voice has a **Performance FX** panel with two effects that can be latched or momentary:

| Effect | Parameters | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Tape** | Speed, Wow, Crinkle | Lo-fi tape degradation — slows playback speed, adds pitch wobble and tape crinkle noise |
| **VHS** | Tracking, Dropout, Head Switch | VHS-style artifacts — tracking errors, signal dropouts, and head-switching noise |

Each effect has a **Latch** toggle: when latched, the effect stays on until toggled off; when unlatched, the effect is momentary (active only while held).

### Buffer Export

Each slicer/looper voice has an **Export** button that saves the current audio buffer as a WAV file. Exported files are saved to the project's `audio/` folder with a timestamped filename. Audio files are isolated per project — each project maintains its own `audio/` directory alongside the `.grn` file.

### Looper Mode Controls

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Rate** | Playback speed (0.25x to 4x) |
| **Reverse** | Toggle reverse playback |
| **Loop Start** | Start position within the buffer (0-1) |
| **Loop End** | End position within the buffer (0-1) |
| **Cut (1-8)** | Eight cut buttons that jump the playback position to evenly-spaced points in the buffer. Press Cut 1 to jump to the start, Cut 5 to jump to the middle, etc. |

> **Tip:** The cut buttons are designed for live performance. Load a drum loop and rapidly tap different cut positions to create stutter and rearrangement effects. Combine with rate changes and reverse for glitch-style performance. The looper output can also be routed as an exciter source for the Resonator, creating pitched resonances from rhythmic material.

### Recording

Each slicer/looper voice supports recording from external inputs or internal engine sources:

| Setting | Options |
|---|---|
| **Mode** | One-Shot (default — record once, buffer normalizes to recorded length on stop) or Live Loop (continuous overdub with wrapping) |
| **Source** | External (microphone/audio input), or internal engine channels |
| **Feedback** | Live loop overdub level (0 = destructive replace, 1 = full layer) |

> **Note:** The default recording mode is **One-Shot**, which normalizes the buffer to the actual recorded length when you stop. This ensures the waveform display and slice boundaries reflect only the recorded content, not the full pre-allocated buffer.
