## Main Window Layout

The main window is divided into two areas:

1. **Transport bar** (top) — transport controls, BPM, and clock pads.
2. **Workspace area** (below) — the currently selected tab's content.

Two additional **floating windows** can be opened from the transport bar:
- **Mixer** — channel levels, pans, sends, and master
- **Oscilloscope** — real-time waveform display with dual-source overlay

## Transport & Tab Bar

The top area is split into two rows:

**Transport bar** (upper row) — from left to right:

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Play / Stop** | Start or stop the master transport (sequencer + drum machine) |
| **Record** | Toggle master output recording (WAV capture) |
| **BPM** | Draggable tempo display (range 20-300 BPM) |
| **Tap Tempo** | Tap repeatedly to set BPM from your tapping interval |
| **Clock Pads (1-8)** | Eight configurable clock outputs; tap to open configuration popover |
| **Mixer** | Toggle the floating mixer window |
| **Scope** | Toggle the floating oscilloscope window |

**Tab bar** (lower row) — workspace tabs plus context-specific controls:

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Tab Buttons** | SEQ, SYNTHS, GRAINS, DRUMS |
| **Context Controls** | When the SEQ tab is active, swing controls (amount, grid, algorithm) appear inline in the tab bar |

## Workspace Tabs

| Tab | Short Name | Content |
|---|---|---|
| SEQUENCER | SEQ | Step sequencer (2 tracks × 8 steps) + chord sequencer + Scramble |
| SYNTHS | SYNTHS | Macro Osc and Resonator synthesis panels |
| GRANULAR | GRAINS | Sub-navigation for granular voices, slicer, and looper |
| DRUMS | DRUMS | DaisyDrums engine + 4-lane × 16-step drum sequencer with pattern bank |

The **GRAINS** tab uses sub-navigation within the tab content area. Voice tabs (Voice 1-4, Slicer, Looper) appear at the top of the workspace rather than in the main tab bar, keeping the main tabs clean while providing full access to all 6 voices.
