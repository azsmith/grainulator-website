## Main Window Layout

The main window is divided into two areas:

1. **Transport bar** (top) — transport controls, BPM, clock pads, and tab navigation.
2. **Workspace area** (below) — the currently selected tab's content.

Two additional **floating windows** can be opened from the transport bar:
- **Mixer** — channel levels, pans, sends, and master
- **Oscilloscope** — real-time waveform display with dual-source overlay
