## Mixer

### Signal Flow

```
Synthesis Engines → Per-Channel (Level, Pan, Inserts) → Mix Bus
                 └→ Send A (Delay bus) → FX Return A → Mix Bus
                 └→ Send B (Reverb bus) → FX Return B → Mix Bus
                                                          │

### 8 Channel Strips

| Channel | Source |
|---|---|
| 0 | Macro Osc |
| 1 | Resonator |
| 2 | Granular 1 |
| 3 | Looper 1 |
| 4 | Looper 2 |
| 5 | Granular 2 |
| 6 | Drums |
| 7 | Sampler |

### Per-Channel Controls

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Level** | Channel volume (0-200%) |
| **Pan** | Stereo position |
| **Mute / Solo** | Per-channel mute and solo |
| **Send A / B** | Delay and reverb send levels |
| **Send Mode** | Pre or post fader |
| **Insert 1 / 2** | AU or VST3 plugin slots |
| **Micro Delay** | 0-50ms stereo delay for width |
| **Phase** | Polarity invert |

> **Tip:** Use micro delay on selected channels (even 1-5ms) to create subtle stereo width through the Haas effect.

## Delay

Tape-style delay with analog character:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| **Time** | Delay repeat interval |
| **Feedback** | Regeneration amount (near max = self-oscillation) |
| **Mix** | Dry/wet balance |
| **Wow** | Low-frequency pitch wobble (tape speed variation) |
| **Flutter** | High-frequency pitch wobble (motor instability) |
| **Tone** | Dark (tape-saturated) to bright (clean) |
| **Sync** | Free-running or tempo-synced |

## Reverb

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| **Size** | Room size (small room to infinite space) |
| **Damping** | High-frequency damping |
| **Mix** | Dry/wet balance |

## Master Filter

Global filter on the master output with cutoff, resonance, and 10 model variants (same as the granular filter models).

## Master Compressor / Limiter

Feed-forward dynamics processor with Threshold, Ratio, Attack, Release, Knee, Makeup Gain, Parallel Mix, Limiter mode, and Auto Gain.

---

## Master Clock & Modulation

### Clock Outputs (8)

Eight configurable outputs in CLK (trigger) or LFO (continuous modulation) mode.

Per-output settings: Waveform (8 types), Division, Level, Offset, Phase, Width, Slow Mode, Mute.

### Waveform Types

Gate, Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth, Ramp, Square, Random, Sample & Hold.

### 25 Modulation Destinations

Route any clock output to parameters across all engines:

- **Macro Osc:** Harmonics, Timbre, Morph, LPG Decay
- **Resonator:** Structure, Brightness, Damping, Position
- **Delay:** Time, Feedback, Wow, Flutter
- **Granular 1/2:** Speed, Pitch, Size, Density, Filter
- **DaisyDrums:** Harmonics, Timbre, Morph
