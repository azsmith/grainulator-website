## Step Sequencer

**2 tracks × 8 steps** with extensive per-step control. The two tracks run independently — each with its own clock division, direction, loop range, and output target.

### Track Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Output** | Macro Osc, Resonator, Both, Drums, or Sampler |
| **CHD** | Chord-follow toggle |
| **Direction** | 12 playback modes |
| **Division** | 20 clock divisions |
| **Octave** | Base octave offset (-4 to +4) |
| **Loop Start/End** | Loop range (steps 1-8) |

### Per-Step Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| **Note Slot** | Degree in current scale (0-8) |
| **Probability** | Chance of triggering (0-100%) |
| **Ratchets** | Repetitions within the step (1-8) |
| **Gate Mode** | EVERY, FIRST, LAST, TIE, REST |
| **Step Type** | PLAY, SKIP, ELIDE, REST, TIE |
| **Slide** | Portamento to next note |

### Direction Modes (12)

Forward, Reverse, Alternate, Random, Skip 2, Skip 3, Climb 2, Climb 3, Drunk Walk, Random No Repeat, Converge, Diverge.

### Scale System (42 Scales)

Major, Natural Minor, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Locrian, Whole Tone, Major/Minor Pentatonic, Bebop scales, Blues, Diminished, Neapolitan, Hungarian, Persian, Balinese, Oriental, Chromatic, and more — plus a dynamic Chord Sequencer mode.

### Accumulator System

Per-step evolving pitch offset with Transpose, Range, Trigger mode (per-stage/pulse/ratchet), and Mode (per-step or shared across track).

## Chord Sequencer

**1-8 step chord progression** integrated with the step sequencer's scale system. When scale is set to "Chord Sequencer" (scale #41), note slots map to chord tones.

### Per-Step Configuration

- **Degree** — root of chord relative to key (12 options: I through vii)
- **Quality** — chord type (17 options: Major, Minor, Diminished, Augmented, Sus2, Sus4, Power, Maj7, m7, Dom7, Half-dim, Full-dim, Dom9, Maj9, m9, Dom11, Dom13)
- **Active** — mute individual steps

### Preset Categories

Pop/Rock, Jazz, Blues/Soul, Folk/Country, Minor/Dark, Modal/Ambient.

## Scramble (Probabilistic Sequencer)

Marbles-inspired probabilistic sequencer with gate patterns, quantized note sequences, and modulation CV.

### Gate Generator

Three simultaneous gate outputs with 7 modes: Coin Toss, Ratio, Alternating, Drums, Markov, Clusters, Divider.

Controls: Bias, Length, Jitter, Deja Vu (Off/On/Locked), Loop length (1-16 steps).

### Note Generator

Three note outputs quantized to current scale. Control modes: Identical (unison), Tilt (fan spread), Bump (contrary motion).

Controls: Spread, Bias, Smooth/Quantize, Range (1/2/4 octaves), Deja Vu.

### Deja Vu

Pattern memory system — **Off** (fresh random), **On** (probabilistic replay), **Locked** (frozen loop).

## Drum Sequencer

**4 lanes × 16 steps** synced to master transport. Each lane triggers a DaisyDrums engine with per-step velocity and per-lane Harmonics/Timbre/Morph controls.
