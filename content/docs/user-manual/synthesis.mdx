## Macro Osc

Macro Osc is a macro-oscillator with **24 synthesis engines**, based on the full Mutable Instruments Macro Osc firmware. Every engine shares three main knobs — **Harmonics**, **Timbre**, and **Morph** — whose meaning changes per engine.

### Common Controls

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Harmonics** | Model-dependent primary shape control |
| **Timbre** | Model-dependent spectral/brightness control |
| **Morph** | Model-dependent blend/variation control |
| **Level** | Voice output level (0-100%) |
| **Frequency / Note** | MIDI note pitch |
| **Trigger** | Manual gate button |

### LPG (Low-Pass Gate)

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Attack** | LPG envelope attack time |
| **Decay** | LPG envelope decay time |
| **Color** | LPG filter character (0 = pure VCA, 1 = VCA + low-pass filter) |
| **Bypass** | Disable the LPG entirely |

### Continuous Engines (0-10)

These produce sound continuously while gated:

| # | Name | Musical Character |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Virtual Analog** | Classic subtractive synth — fat basses, leads, pads |
| 1 | **Waveshaper** | Wavefolding distortion — edgy, harmonically rich tones |
| 2 | **Two-Op FM** | Two-operator FM — electric pianos, bells, metallic textures |
| 3 | **Granular Formant** | VOSIM/Pulsar synthesis — vocal formants, buzzy textures |
| 4 | **Harmonic** | Additive synthesis with 24 harmonics — organ-like, evolving |
| 5 | **Wavetable** | Wavetable scanning — 4 banks of 8×8 wavetables + user bank |
| 6 | **Chords** | Four-note chord generator — instant pads and stabs |
| 7 | **Speech** | Vocal synthesis — robotic speech, vowel drones |
| 8 | **Granular Cloud** | Micro-enveloped grains — ambient textures, shimmer |
| 9 | **Filtered Noise** | Clocked noise through resonant filter — hi-hats, wind |
| 10 | **Particle Noise** | Dust particles through bandpass — crackle, rain |

### Triggered Engines (11-15)

These have internal envelopes and decay naturally:

| # | Name | Musical Character |
|---|---|---|
| 11 | **String** | Karplus-Strong — plucked strings, harps, metallic twangs |
| 12 | **Modal** | Modal resonator — bells, marimbas, glass |
| 13 | **Bass Drum** | Analog-style kick — tight 808 to booming sub |
| 14 | **Snare Drum** | Analog-style snare — rimshots to loose rattles |
| 15 | **Hi-Hat** | Analog-style hi-hat — metallic overtones |

### Six-Op FM (16)

DX7-style 6-operator FM with 32 algorithms and DX7 `.syx` patch loading. Harmonics sweeps algorithms, Timbre controls modulation depth, Morph adjusts operator balance.

### Engine Crossfade

When switching models, a **30ms crossfade** prevents clicks.

### Custom Wavetable Loading

When the **Wavetable** model is selected, a **LOAD WAVETABLE** button appears. Load custom wavetables into bank 4 (user bank). Set Harmonics ≥ 0.8 to select the user bank.

## Resonator

Physical-modeling resonator based on Mutable Instruments Rings. Can be excited by its internal source or by audio from other engines.

### Controls

| Control | Description |
|---|---|
| **Structure** | Resonator geometry |
| **Brightness** | Excitation brightness |
| **Damping** | Decay time of resonances |
| **Position** | Excitation position |
| **FM** | Frequency modulation amount |
| **Level** | Output level |

### Models (6)

| # | Name | Character |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Modal** | Bells, bars, plates, tuned percussion |
| 1 | **Sympathetic** | Sitar, tanpura, prepared piano |
| 2 | **String** | Plucked/bowed string — guitar, harp, cello |
| 3 | **FM Voice** | FM through resonator — crystalline tones |
| 4 | **Symp Quant** | Sympathetic with quantized tuning |
| 5 | **String+Rev** | String with built-in reverb |

### Polyphony

Three modes: **1**, **2**, or **4** voices. Chord types available: Oct, 5th, sus4, min, m7, m9, m11, 69, M9, M7, Maj.

## DaisyDrums

5 percussive synthesis engines with three shared macro knobs each:

| Engine | Character |
|---|---|
| **Analog Kick** | Punch, tone, and decay control |
| **Synth Kick** | Harmonics shaping |
| **Analog Snare** | Noise amount and body balance |
| **Synth Snare** | Harmonics shaping |
| **Hi-Hat** | Metallic tone, open/closed |

## SoundFont / WAV Sampler

Supports SF2, SFZ, and multi-sample WAV formats with ADSR envelope, filter cutoff/resonance, and tuning controls.
